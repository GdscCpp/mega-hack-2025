## Inspiration

We were inspired by the struggle of individuals facing the growing impact of artificial intelligence on their careers and lives. We recognized the need for a platform where people could share their experiences and connect with others navigating similar challenges, especially the feeling of being "replaced by AI."

## What it does

AmICookedChat is a platform that allows users to share their personal stories and experiences related to the impact of AI on their livelihoods. It provides a feed of forum posts where individuals can discuss whether they feel they've been replaced or significantly impacted by AI advancements. Users can read, share, and engage with these stories, fostering a sense of community and shared understanding.
## How we built it

We built AmICookedChat using:

    Next.js: for the frontend framework, enabling server-side rendering and efficient routing.
    Tailwind CSS: for styling, allowing for rapid and responsive UI development.
    Supabase: for the backend, providing database management, authentication, and real-time updates. We used Supabase to store and retrieve forum posts, manage user data, and handle interactions.

## Challenges we ran into

    Database Integration (Supabase): This was the team's first experience working with a database, leading to challenges in understanding database schemas, query optimization, and data security.
    Next.js Learning Curve: Most of the team were new to Next.js, requiring significant time to grasp concepts like server-side rendering, server actions, and data fetching.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
